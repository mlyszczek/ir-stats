# This is example file that contains all config options that program will
# support. Lines starting with '#' are comments and are ignored.

# this starts option database part of file, it's hardcoded so don't change
# it

>>>> option

# options part is simple CSV formated database, first line of this csv
# contains name of fields that is used by progen, thus it should not be
# modified in your project. Here is a list of fields:
#
# * type
#       simple C type, (int, unsigned, char etc.) of the config. Special
#       type "string" exists which can be used instead of "const char *"
#
# * map-list (optional)
#       This is list that maps integers to strings. This can be used when
#       you want to allow user to specify value with string but in code
#       you want to keep it as integer (for speed or because it makes sense).
#       Good example here is log level. Internal embedlog uses integers for
#       log levels, but it makes sense for user to be able to pass string
#       like "notice or error" instead of 3 or 5, which is easier to remember.
#       In our example, when user passes --log-level=crit, "crit" string will
#       be converted to 2 (because crit is 3rd on the list), and "fatal" will
#       be 0. Values are indexed from 0. If uses passes something that is not
#       on the list - error will be returned to him. This is optional, if
#       skipped, user will have to provide ordinary integer values. If this
#       is specified, only strings will work, so --log-level=0 will not work.
#       Elements are delimited with ":" character.
#
# * section (optional)
#       Name of the section, this will be part of full config name, and as
#       [section] in generated INI file. This can be empty, in that case
#       only name field will be used as variable, macro and config name.
#
# * name
#       Name of the config, with "section" forms full config name. If
#       section is not specified, only name will be used (example after
#       or, obviously)
#
#       For options passed with arguments, full option will be in form
#           --section-name or --name
#
#       In C code, option will be in form:
#           section_name or name
#       and all '-' characters will be converted to '_'.
#
#       In INI file, option will be in form
#           [section]
#           name = value
#
#       or if section is not passed, fields will be on top of config file
#       without [section]:
#           name = value
#
# * shortopt (optional)
#       When specified, user will be able to specify option using shortopt.
#       If you do not specify it, and you compile program with
#       -DPROJECT_ENABLE_GETOPT (and not -DPROJECT_ENABLE_GETOPT_LONG)
#       so that only short options are used, user will not be able to
#       set these options via command line.
#
# * default
#       Default value if it is not specified by user. Must match given type
#       for option. When map-list is set, should be one of the entries in
#       the map list.
#
# * min and max
#       Minimal and maximal value for option. For integers macros like
#       INT_MAX or SIZE_MAX can be used, if map-list is specified this is
#       ignored (map list is limiting options itself), for strings, this
#       defines how long string can be.
#
# * guard (optional)
#       It may be possible that you might want some options to be disabled
#       when some conditions are not met. For example, you might want your
#       program to support instalations that does not have support for SSL,
#       and for those systemd, there is virtually no need to have SSL
#       related config fields and while this is usually no big deal for
#       big OSes like Linux, it may pose some problems for hardcore
#       embedded systems where each byte counts.
#
#       So, you can specify here name of the macro expression to evaluate,
#       so this can be as simple as `HAVE_SSL' or `HAVE_SSL && HAVE_UDP',
#       which will result in something like
#
#           #if HAVE_SSL
#               do something
#           #endif
#
#           #if HAVE_SSL && HAVE_UDP
#               do code
#           #endif
#
#       If not specified, option will be always present in code.
#
# * required
#       Defines if argument is required for option or not. Can be one of
#
#       * no
#           option does not take any argument, used as flag like
#               program --flag -c
#
#       * optional (NOT SUPPORTED YET)
#           option takes argument but is optional, like
#               program --flag
#           or
#               program --flag=4
#
#           Both are valid
#
#       * required
#           option takes argument and that argument must be specified or
#           error will be emited.
#               program --flag=4
#           and
#               program --flag
#
#           will return error.
#
# * valname
#       Value name for help message. When --help is printed, it will look
#       like this:
#
#           --section-name=<valname>
#
#       So in our example it will look like it:
#
#       -l, --log-level=<level>
#           --log-path=<path>
#
#       Where "level" and "path" are valname
#
# * description
#       Short description of option, used in help message in format
#
#           --section-name=<valname>        description
#
#       So in our example it will look like it:
#
#       -l, --log-level=<level>     maximum log level to print
#           --log-path=<path>       path where to store logs
#
# spaces are also removed from first line, so you can pad them for better
# readability.

>>> log-level

defines how much verbose program will be about what it does

  fatal  - fatal errors, application cannot continue to run
  alert  - major failure that needs immediate attention
  crit   - critical errors
  error  - error but recoverable
  warn   - warnings
  notice - normal message, but of high importance
  info   - informations log, doesn't print that much, recommended
  debug  - debug, prints a lot of not really needed things in normal usage

if set, logs will contain pretty colors to quickly find
information debugger might need. Note that not all terminals
support it! Either 0 or 1 is supported

username program should run on, for security reason it should not
